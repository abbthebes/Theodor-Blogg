## About the blog
 
This is a blog that contains multiple articles about some of my favorite algorithms. The algorithms are also very easy and useful. In the posts I there is a basic explanation of the algorithms, some code and text to explain how to implement it and lastly some practical examples. The blog is aimed at people who are interested in software development, know some syntax in a programming language and want to get better. Reading these useful posts would be a valuable and enjoyable read. This blog was inspired by <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/117672893/Cooking-blog?tracking_source=search_projects%7Cblog%20design" >this<SquareArrowUpRIght/></a> design.
